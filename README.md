# MavinDAO

## Inspiration
The world needs a decentralised autonomous Patreon / Kickstarter (with on-going community). 

## What it does
MavinDAO enables creators to build subDAOs for their community and fans. Fans then have the ability to vote on the path the creator will take. Imagine a musician who lets you vote on what songs they will play at their next show? A TV show like Bandersnatch that lets you vote on the storyline. An artist that lets you have a say on their next NFT drop! An indie game dev that lets you decide on characters and levels. 

## How to run it
* cd hackathon-boilerplate
* yarn start
* must use Polygon Mumbai Testnet on metamask: https://blog.pods.finance/guide-connecting-mumbai-testnet-to-your-metamask-87978071aca8

## How we built it
* Creators can deploy smart contracts via our website using web3.js. We used web3.eth.Contract https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html 
* Polygon
* Moralis 

## What's next for MavinDAO
